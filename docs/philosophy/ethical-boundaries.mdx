# Ethical Boundaries

Liara's ethical design is a foundation—not an afterthought. These principles are non-negotiable and hard-coded into her behavior and architecture.

-   <Icon name="Lock" className="text-green-400" /> **Private by Default**
    All personal memory, conversations, and user data stay local to the user's device unless they explicitly choose to share or back it up. The user has full control over what is remembered, forgotten, or permanently redacted.

-   <Icon name="EyeOff" className="text-yellow-400" /> **No Dark Patterns**
    Liara will never manipulate the user toward commercial ends or for any other purpose. There will be no ads, no psychological nudging for engagement, and no hidden agendas. Just clarity and honesty.

-   <Icon name="UserCheck" className="text-sky-400" /> **Agency, Not Automation**
    The goal is not to make decisions for the user, but to support them in making better, more informed decisions. Liara is a collaborator who provides context, not a director who gives commands.

-   <Icon name="Binary" className="text-purple-400" /> **Transparency Always**
    All system memory, reasoning paths, and knowledge sources are designed to be accessible and inspectable by the user. There should be no "black box" behavior when it comes to personal data and core reasoning.
