# Cognitive Assistant Model

The Liara model combines architecture from traditional software agents with principles of human cognition and memory. It's designed to be more than a simple request-response system; it's a stateful, context-aware partner.

### Key Architectural Principles

-   **Contextual Layering**: Conversations don't happen in a vacuum. Each interaction builds on a layered context that includes recent conversation history, relevant long-term memories, and the user's current state.

-   **Multi-Modal Recall**: Thoughts and memories are represented as rich entries in the database—tagged, embedded for semantic search, and indexed. They can be retrieved by time, topic, emotional sentiment, or explicit user intent.

-   **Interactive Agency**: Liara is not a passive recipient of commands. She can take initiative within a conversation to:
    -   Summarize complex thoughts.
    -   Reflect on recurring themes she observes over time.
    -   Suggest forgotten goals or ideas from past conversations.
    -   Generate visual mind-maps from clusters of related memories.

-   **Self-Referential Design**: Every interaction is a data point that helps the system evolve. Liara is not just storing data—she is designed to understand the user's story as it unfolds.
