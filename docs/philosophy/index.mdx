# Liara's Philosophy

This section of the documentation outlines the core principles, design philosophy, and ethical framework that guide the development of Liara. It answers the "why" behind the project, not just the "what" or "how."

The philosophy is centered on three key areas:
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/philosophy/purpose-goals">Purpose & Goals</Keyword>: The fundamental mission and vision for Liara.
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/philosophy/cognitive-assistant-model">Cognitive Assistant Model</Keyword>: The theoretical framework for how Liara functions as a thinking partner.
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/philosophy/ethical-boundaries">Ethical Boundaries</Keyword>: The non-negotiable rules governing privacy, agency, and transparency.
