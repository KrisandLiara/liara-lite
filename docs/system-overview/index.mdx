# Liara: System Overview

Welcome to the Liara Knowledge Base. This is the central source of truth for understanding the Liara application, from high-level architecture to low-level implementation details.

This documentation serves as both a technical reference for developers and a conceptual guide for understanding the system's behavior and design philosophy.

## How This Knowledge Base is Structured

This documentation is a living project, built using MDX, which allows for a rich combination of Markdown and interactive React components.

-   **Interactive Diagrams**: We use Mermaid.js, wrapped in a custom `DiagramSpoiler` component, to create diagrams that explain complex workflows and architectures. Many diagrams are interactive.
-   **Component Library**: Reusable components from the main application are used to ensure consistency.
-   **Linked Keywords**: Key terms are highlighted and linked, like this: <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/philosophy">Liara's Philosophy</Keyword>, to provide quick access to related concepts.

## High-Level Application Flow

At its core, Liara facilitates a conversation between a user and an advanced AI, with a robust backend orchestrating the process.

### Core Components:

1.  **Frontend**: A **React (Vite)** single-page application that provides the user interface. It communicates with the backend via a REST API. For more, see the <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/architecture/frontend">Frontend Architecture</Keyword>.
2.  **Backend**: A **Node.js (Express)** server that handles business logic, orchestrates AI interactions, and manages the database. It's the brain of the operation. Dive deeper into the <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/backend/server-overview">Backend Overview</Keyword>.
3.  **Database**: We use **Supabase**, which provides a **PostgreSQL** database and authentication services. It stores user data, conversations, and long-term AI memories. Explore the <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/database/01-schema-and-tables">Database Schema</Keyword>.
4.  **AI / LLM**: The AI logic is handled by external Large Language Models. The backend prepares and sends data to these models, then processes their responses. Understand more about <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/modules/personality-engine">AI Personas</Keyword>.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/architecture/application-architecture">Application Architecture</Keyword> page to get a bird's-eye view. For developers looking to set up their environment, the <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/development/dev-environment-script">Development Setup</Keyword> guide is the place to start.

## Import Pipeline: Start Here

The import pipeline is one of the most actively developed areas. For the full experience and diagrams:
