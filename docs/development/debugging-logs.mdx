# Debugging & Logs

This guide provides tips and instructions for debugging the different components of the Liara application.

## Accessing Logs

When you run `npm run liara:dev`, the output from the frontend server, backend server, and Supabase services are all streamed to a single terminal. To make this manageable, each line is prefixed with the name of the process that generated it (e.g., `[frontend]`, `[backend]`).

**Example Log Output:**
```log
[backend]    | Server listening on port 8000
[frontend]   | VITE v4.4.9  ready in 780 ms
[supabase]   | Applying migration 20231026120000_initial_schema.sql...
```

To debug a specific service, you should focus on the lines prefixed with its name.

## Frontend Debugging

For frontend issues (UI bugs, state management problems):
1.  Open your browser's developer tools (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2.  Use the **Console** tab to check for errors and log messages.
3.  Use the **Components** tab (if you have the React DevTools extension) to inspect the component hierarchy and their state/props.
4.  Use the **Network** tab to inspect API requests being made to the backend.

## Backend Debugging (VS Code)

To debug the backend Node.js server, it's recommended to use the VS Code debugger.

1.  **Stop `liara:dev`**: If the main script is running, stop it with `Ctrl+C`.
2.  **Start Services Individually**:
    *   In one terminal, run `supabase start`.
    *   In another terminal, navigate to `liara-backend` and run `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
3.  **Configure the Debugger**: Create a `launch.json` file inside a `.vscode` directory in the *root* of the project with the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Attach to Backend",
                "port": 9229, // Default inspect port
                "restart": true,
                "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
4.  **Start Debugging**: Go to the "Run and Debug" panel in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+D`), select "Attach to Backend" from the dropdown, and press `F5`. The debugger will attach to the running `nodemon` process.
5.  You can now set breakpoints directly in the backend TypeScript code in VS Code.
