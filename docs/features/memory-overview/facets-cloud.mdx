# Facets & Cloud

Facets and the keyword cloud work together to provide a responsive, contextual view of your memory space.

## Facets

- Buckets: keyword, entity.person/org/product/location/event, date, date bucket
- INCLUDE adds the value; EXCLUDE removes matching memories from results
- Counts rebalance after every selection

## Keyword Cloud

- Size scales with frequency (log scale)
- Click to include; Shift+Click to exclude
- Selected values are highlighted; non‑co‑occurring values dim
