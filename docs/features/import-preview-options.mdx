# Preview Options & Filters

## Preview Options
- **Show tags**: toggles header chips and inline tag underlines
- **Compact messages**: reduces vertical spacing for faster scanning
- **Show placeholders**: displays removed code as emerald placeholders; these do not count as code

## Filters
- **Has code**: shows conversations with renderable code blocks (placeholders excluded)
- **Has images**: shows conversations with images or image‑generation content
- **Has voice**: shows conversations with voice content; voice tag scroll targets only problematic voice (no transcript)

Tips:
- Filters are additive; enable multiple to narrow the view
- Placeholders are visualization only and won’t trigger “Has code”
