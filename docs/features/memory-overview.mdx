# Memory Overview

The Memory Overview provides a fast, scannable way to explore your memories using contextual facets and a keyword tag cloud. A Tag Inspector lets you dive deep on any tag to see co-facets, timelines, and representative examples.

## What you can do

- Filter using facets (keywords, entities, date buckets) with INCLUDE and EXCLUDE
- Use the keyword cloud to add filters quickly
- See facet counts rebalance to the current selection
- Open the Tag Inspector for a tag to view:
  - Top co‑facets across buckets
  - Timeline (YYYY‑MM) of occurrence
  - Source breakdown (chat vs. other)
  - Example memories (newest first)

## Interactions

- Click a chip: INCLUDE
- Shift+Click: EXCLUDE
- Alt/Option+Click: add another INCLUDE (OR within the same bucket)
- Press Escape to close the inspector

## Performance

Facet counts are precomputed with materialized views and refreshed after imports. All counts are user‑scoped.

## Test vs Production

When Test Mode is enabled, the overview reads from `test_hard_memory_entries` and `mv_test_hme_facet_counts`. Production mode uses `hard_memory_entries` and `mv_hme_facet_counts`.
