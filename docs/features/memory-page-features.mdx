## Tag Explorer & Multi-Stage Search

The Memory Page includes a powerful Tag Explorer to help you navigate your memories thematically. You can access it by clicking the **"By Tag"** link in the Memory Menu sidebar. The explorer uses a new multi-stage search process to give you more control.

### 1. The Tag Cloud

Upon entering the Tag Explorer, you are presented with a **Tag Cloud**.

- **Visual Weight**: Tags are sized based on their frequency. More frequently used tags appear larger, allowing you to see your most common themes at a glance.
- **Interactivity**: Every tag in the cloud is clickable, acting as the starting point for your search.

### 2. Viewing Memories by Tag (Multi-Stage Search)

Clicking on any tag in the cloud takes you to a dedicated view that begins a controlled, multi-stage search.

-   **Stage 1: Exact Tag Match (Default)**
    -   The view initially loads and displays **only** memories that are explicitly assigned the selected tag.
    -   This provides a precise, narrow set of results based on your deliberate categorization.

-   **Stage 2: Keyword Search (Optional)**
    -   If you want to broaden the search, you can click the **"Keyword"** button.
    -   This performs a new search, finding all memories where the tag's name appears as a keyword in the content or summary.

-   **Stage 3: Semantic Search (Optional)**
    -   To cast the widest net, you can click the **"Semantic"** button.
    -   This uses vector embeddings to find memories that are conceptually related, even if they don't share any keywords.
    -   You can use the **Similarity** slider to adjust how closely related the results should be.

This staged approach ensures that your initial view is focused and relevant, while still providing powerful tools for deeper exploration when you need them.

  **How it works:** The size of each tag is calculated based on its total count relative to the most and least frequent tags in your memory database.

### Viewing Memories by Tag

Clicking on any tag in the cloud will take you to a dedicated view that lists all of the memories associated with that specific tag. This allows you to easily review all your thoughts and notes on a particular topic.

From this view, you can:
- See a chronological list of all memories for the tag.
- Click on any memory card to view its full details.
- Delete memories.
