# Import Feature Overview

This page summarizes the Import feature and provides a structured, single place to learn the end‑to‑end flow. From here you can jump to focused sub‑pages for each area (stages, options, tags/NER, data flow), but you’ll also find concise explanations inline so you can get productive quickly.

## Quick Start

1. Open Import → Step 1. Use the unified selector to pick a Preprocessed or Enriched file, or choose “Import JSON file” to process a local export.
2. Click Preview.
   - If you selected a Source JSON, the browser processes it locally and opens the Preprocessed preview.
   - If Preprocessed, the preview loads immediately.
   - If Enriched, you’ll see the Enriched preview with Stage 3–4 bubbles.
3. Use Preview Options (left) and Filters (right) to refine what you see.
4. When satisfied, Enrich (Step 3) and then Load (Step 4) to the database.

## Unified File Selector

- Shows Preprocessed and Enriched files in one place
- Adds a “Import JSON file” (Source) option to process a local conversations file
- The selector appears in three places: Index page (Step 1), Preprocessed preview (Step 2–3), and Enriched preview (Step 3–4)
- Preview button routes by type:
  - Preprocessed → load preview by filename
  - Enriched → enriched preview by filename
  - Source → run client‑side processing (existing preprocessor) and open Preprocessed preview

## Stages at a Glance

Four conceptual stages organize the pipeline:

- **1. Import**: Choose a file or bring a local `conversations.json` (Source). Nothing is saved yet.
- **2. Preprocess**: Apply author filters, remove code (context preserved via placeholders), save a preprocessed file when ready.
- **3. Enrich**: Generate tags, summaries, embeddings, optional NER (user‑only or full message set). Token estimator shows cost/time.
- **4. Load**: Import enriched results into the memory database. In Test Mode we load into `test_memories`.

## Preview Options & Filters

Left bubble (Preview Options):
- **Show tags**: toggles inline tag underlines and header chips
- **Compact messages**: denser vertical spacing
- **Show placeholders**: visualizes removed code as emerald placeholders (never counted as code)

Right bubble (Filters):
- **Has code / images / voice**: limits conversations shown to those with that content type

## Tags & Named Entities (NER)

- **Tags**: AI-generated topical labels. Clicking a tag opens the conversation and cycles through matching messages. Literal matches get subtle colored underlines.
- **NER**: Extracted entities by category (PERSON, ORG, LOC, DATE, PRODUCT, EVENT). In content, they render in bold with subtle glow; category‑colored tooltips show on hover. Clicking an entity also scrolls to matching messages. If a literal highlight isn’t found but the data exists, we show a transient “close match” badge.
- **Scroll Parity**: Visual highlights match the scroll targets. Fallback hints appear only when a literal target cannot be highlighted.

## Notes & Tips

- “Source” processing is entirely client‑side until you Save or Enrich
- Placeholders indicate removed code but aren’t counted as “Has code”
- Image and voice tags only scroll when those items are present (we skip messages with placeholders only)
