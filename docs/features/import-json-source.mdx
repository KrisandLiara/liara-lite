# Importing Source JSON

You can now import a raw ChatGPT `conversations.json` file directly from the browser without first creating a preprocessed file on the server.

## How it works

- Use the unified file selector and choose "Import JSON file" (Source)
- Pick your local `conversations.json`
- Click Preview
- The app runs the existing browser‑side processing (`handleProcess`) and shows the Preprocessed preview
- When you click Apply & Save or run Enrich, the preprocessed results are saved to the backend as usual

## Where the option appears

- Index page (Step 1)
- Preprocessed preview header (Step 2–3)

## Why client‑side?

- Faster feedback loop (no server round‑trip just to preview)
- Works even before saving a preprocessed artifact
- Keeps backend authoritative only when we persist (save or enrich)
