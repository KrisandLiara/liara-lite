# Chat Features

This document outlines the key features of the chat system, including session management and guest mode.

## Session Management

The chat system now supports robust session management. Each user interaction is tied to a session, allowing for a continuous conversation flow.

- **Session Creation**: New sessions are automatically created when a user starts a new conversation.
- **Session Resumption**: Users can resume previous sessions, maintaining conversation history and context.

## Guest Mode

Guest mode allows users to interact with the chat system without needing to create an account.

- **Anonymous Access**: Users can chat anonymously.
- **Limited History**: Conversation history in guest mode might be limited or not persisted across different browser sessions.

## Technical Implementation (Optional)

Details about the underlying Supabase functions and database schema supporting these features can be found in their respective documentation files.
