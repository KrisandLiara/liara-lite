# Planned Features

This page outlines the major features and improvements that are planned for future versions of Liara. This list is not exhaustive and is subject to change.

## Core Functionality

-   **Enhanced Memory Management**: A dedicated UI for users to view, edit, and delete individual memories. This will give users full control over their data.

-   **Proactive Memory Consolidation**: An automated background process that periodically reviews chat history to find and save new, important memories without user intervention.

-   **Relational Memory Graph**: Implementing the <a href="/app/system-overview/tables/memory-relationships">`memory_relationships`</a> table to connect related memories, allowing the AI to form more complex associations and reasoning chains.

## User Experience

-   **Streaming Audio Input/Output**: True, real-time voice conversation instead of the current "press-to-talk, wait-for-response" model.

-   **Multi-Modal Support**: The ability to understand and respond to images in addition to text and voice.

-   **Customizable Personas**: An interface for users to easily create and switch between different AI personalities.

## Technical Improvements

-   **Full Test Coverage**: Implementing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to improve code quality and prevent regressions.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline**: A fully automated pipeline for testing, building, and deploying the application to production.
