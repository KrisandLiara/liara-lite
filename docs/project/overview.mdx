# Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Liara project.

Liara is an advanced, voice-first AI assistant designed to provide a seamless and intelligent conversational experience. The project's core mission is to create an AI companion that can not only understand and respond to user queries but also remember past conversations and learn from them over time.

## Key Goals

-   **Natural Conversation**: The project aims to facilitate natural, human-like conversation through a combination of a high-quality language model, a low-latency streaming interface, and a sophisticated <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/modules/personality-engine">Personality Engine</Keyword>.

-   **Developer-Friendly Architecture**: Liara is built on a modern, modular tech stack that is designed to be easy for developers to understand, maintain, and extend.

-   **Comprehensive Self-Documentation**: This System Overview is a testament to the project's commitment to maintainability. The goal is for the system to be able to document itself, providing a clear and always-up-to-date reference for developers.
