# Product Roadmap

This section outlines the direction, vision, and development progress of the Liara system. It's meant to guide future contributors and track the evolution of Liara from AI assistant to cognitive partner.

The roadmap is broken down into the following sections:
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/roadmap/milestones">Milestones</Keyword>: Major version checkpoints that reflect architectural or feature-complete stages.
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/roadmap/in-progress">In-Progress Features</Keyword>: A list of features that are actively being built or prototyped.
-   <Keyword to="/app/system-overview/roadmap/feature-backlog">Feature Backlog</Keyword>: High-level ideas or experiments to tackle when ready.

### 📅 Planning Rhythm

-   New roadmap items are reviewed monthly.
