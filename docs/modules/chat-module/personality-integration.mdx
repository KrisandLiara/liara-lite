# Personality Integration

Personality is what makes Liara more than just a question-and-answer machine. It's a combination of a core set of instructions and dynamic context that defines her character, tone, and decision-making process.

The live, editable version of Liara's core personality prompt can be found at <Keyword to="/app/personality">/app/personality</Keyword>. This page is Liara's "home," where her fundamental identity is shaped.

## Current Implementation & Future Plans

Currently, Liara's personality is defined by a master "System Prompt." This is a large text document that sets out her goals, her ethical boundaries, how she should behave, and what her name is.

The long-term vision is to evolve this into a more complex system of **LLM Agents**, where Liara can be equipped with different "personas" or specialized agents for specific tasks. This documentation will be updated as that work progresses.

## Prompt Assembly Layers

The final prompt sent to the LLM is not just the user's message. It's a carefully assembled "sandwich" of different layers of context, with the core personality at its base.

        D["Short-Term Context<br/><i>(Recent chat history)</i>"]
        E["User's Latest Message"]

        A --> B --> C --> D --> E
    end

    E --> F{Final Prompt Sent to LLM}

This layered approach ensures that Liara has a consistent core personality while also being able to adapt to the specific user and the immediate context of the conversation.
