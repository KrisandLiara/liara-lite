# Docker Compose

This documentation is pending.

This page will detail how to set up and run the Liara application stack using Docker Compose. This method provides a more consistent and isolated environment compared to running the services directly on the host machine. It will include:
- The structure of the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Instructions on how to build and run the containers.
- Details on networking and how the services connect to each other.
