# Windows note:
# Some Windows setups reserve/exclude TCP port ranges that include the default Supabase local ports
# (54321+). If you see Docker errors like:
#   "Ports are not available ... listen tcp 0.0.0.0:54322: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions."
# Move the local ports to a safe range outside the excluded block (example below uses 5542x).
